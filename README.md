## Algorithm Overview

### Scoring System (0-100 points)

1. Distance (25 pts) - Proximity to user
2. Dietary Compatibility (20 pts) - Dietary restrictions match
3. Allergen Safety (20 pts) - No allergen conflicts
4. Cuisine Preference (15 pts) - User's favorite cuisines
5. Freshness (10 pts) - How recently posted
6. Poster Reputation (10 pts) - Trust score + ratings
7. Time Availability (5 pts) - Pickup window convenience
8. Quality Indicators (5 pts) - Homemade, refrigerated, quantity

### Smart Filtering

* Geo-bounding box for efficient queries
* Real-time availability checks
* Allergen conflict detection
* Dietary restriction validation

## How to Use
